## DESCRIPTION

This repository contains my first coding assignment for the Advanced Javascript Module of the Creative Computing 
programme (4th year) in the Institute of Art, Design & Technology, DÃºn Laoghaire.

This assignment was developed  using the ReactJS JavaScript library and React-Bootstrap. The [Yarn] package manager
was used, as opposed to [NodePackageManager], due to difference in processing speed between the two.

## SETUP

'yarn install'

'yarn start'

## ALTERNATIVE SETUP (NOT TESTED)

'npm install'

'npm start'
